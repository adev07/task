# Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragmentation of Functinality / UI

## My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that

The choices for fragmenting the code into separate components are made to improve readability, maintainability, and reusability of the codebase. Here's a brief justification for why it's beneficial to fragment the code in this manner:

1. DashboardLayoutStyled:
Reason: This component is responsible for styling the layout of the burn page. It provides a consistent layout across the application, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
Importance: By isolating layout styling concerns into a separate component, it becomes easier to manage and modify the layout without affecting other parts of the application. Additionally, it enhances code organization and readability.

2. BurnButtonBar
Reason: The BurnButtonBar component encapsulates UI elements related to burning tokens, such as input fields and buttons.
Importance: Fragmenting these UI elements into a separate component promotes reusability and modularity. It allows for easy integration of the burning functionality into other parts of the application and simplifies maintenance.

3. BurnStatsContainer:
Reason: This component is responsible for displaying statistics related to token burning, such as supply information.
Importance: By isolating the logic and presentation of burn statistics, the BurnStatsContainer component enhances code organization and readability. It makes it easier to manage and update burn-related data without affecting other parts of the application.

4. TransactionTableStyled:
Reason: The TransactionTableStyled component renders a styled transaction table for displaying burn transactions.
Importance: Fragmenting the styling and rendering logic for transaction tables into a separate component improves code maintainability and readability. It allows for easy customization of the table appearance and promotes code reuse across the application.

5. ChainSelector:
Reason: This component provides functionality to select different token chains, allowing users to switch between chains easily.
Importance: The ChainSelector component encapsulates chain selection logic and UI, promoting reusability and modularity. It simplifies the integration of chain selection functionality into various parts of the application and enhances code organization.

6. AppToast:
Reason: The AppToast component displays toast notifications for user feedback, such as success or error messages.
Importance: By isolating toast notification logic and presentation into a separate component, it enhances code maintainability and readability. It allows for easy customization of toast appearance and behavior and promotes consistent user feedback across the application.
